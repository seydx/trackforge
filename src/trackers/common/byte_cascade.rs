//! Shared two-stage association cascade for the ByteTrack family.
//!
//! ByteTrack and BoT-SORT run the same cascade. High confidence detections are matched
//! against the pool of tracked and lost tracks, low confidence detections then try to
//! recover the still-tracked leftovers, unmatched high detections start new tracks, and
//! originally-lost tracks are kept alive until they age out of the buffer.
//!
//! The only thing that differs between the two is the stage-one cost matrix. ByteTrack
//! passes a plain IoU distance; BoT-SORT passes an appearance-fused cost. Camera motion
//! is applied by BoT-SORT before the cascade runs. Everything else lives here once.
